# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Camera
Project Description: Human gestures include different components of visual actions such as motion of hands, facial expression, and torso, to convey meaning. So far, in the field of gesture recognition, most previous works have focused on the manual component of gestures. A hand gesture recognition system provide a natural, innovative and modern way of non verbal communication. It has a wide area of application in human computer interaction and sign language.





Problem Statement/Opportunity:“Hand Gesture Recognition Using Camera ” is based on concept of Image processing. In recent year there is lot of research on gesture recognition using kinect sensor on using HD camera but camera and kinect sensors are more costly. This project is focus on reduce cost and improve robustness of the proposed system using simple web camera
