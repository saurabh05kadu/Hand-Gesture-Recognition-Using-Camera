# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Camera
Project Description: Human gestures include different components of visual actions such as motion of hands, facial expression, and torso, to convey meaning. So far, in the field of gesture recognition, most previous works have focused on the manual component of gestures. A hand gesture recognition system provide a natural, innovative and modern way of non verbal communication. It has a wide area of application in human computer interaction and sign language.





Problem Statement/Opportunity:“Hand Gesture Recognition Using Camera ” is based on concept of Image processing. In recent year there is lot of research on gesture recognition using kinect sensor on using HD camera but camera and kinect sensors are more costly. This project is focus on reduce cost and improve robustness of the proposed system using simple web camera


Early Stopping.
 EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss',patience=10),
    ModelCheckpoint(filepath="model.h5",monitor='val_loss',save_best_only=True,verbose=1)]

01.It is used to stop the model training in between. This function is very helpful when your models get overfitted. 
02.It is used to stop the model as soon as it gets overfitted. 
03.We defined what to monitor while saving the model checkpoints. 
04.We also need to define the factor we want to monitor while using the early stopping function. 
05.We will monitor validation loss for stopping the model training. Use the below code to use the early stopping function.
